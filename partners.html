                    <p>
                      Child Education Trend Initiative (herein after referred to as "CETI") is a community Based organization. It is duly recognized by the Masaka Municipal Council and District authorities.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Its foundation body has no religious inclination or bias. It is liberal and accepts all religious denominations and ethnicity recognized by the government.   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Since it was established in 2009, Child Education Trend Initiative has had a record of providing the basic services to orphans and other vulnerable children. It cares and offers education for children from four years to fifteen years of age.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        CETI champions modern educational trends by empowering children
                        through innovation, community engagement, and inclusive learning
                        programs that prepare them for a dynamic future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       This project is a social development joint venture between the project partners and the parents of the children in Crown Star Junior School. This institution is a charity private Primary School founded in 2009. It is a Christian school dedicated to integrating spiritual values in all aspects of the curriculum through quality education provided to pupils who are either orphans or come from under privileged families in Uganda. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Child Education Trend Initiative has a fully developed programme for extra-curricular activities. Our project has clubs which run in the months of October, November and part of December, football, netball and basketball.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Children are exposed, they love to participate and at the end of it all we have presentations on stage and members of the community enjoy this as well as buying products children have made from art and crafts, bakery and cookery products. Since nobody knows what the future will hold, CETI strikes to ensure that its community members are equipped with skills and knowledge necessary to allow them to take a leading role in the world's future.
